# MineLights

MineLights is a Minecraft Fabric mod that brings RGB lighting integrations to Minecraft Java Edition (targeting latest, 1.21). Currently, it only supports Corsair iCue however due to the modular design, other RGB softwares could (and will) be easily added.

## Features

- **iCue Integration**: Sync your in-game events with your iCue-compatible RGB devices.

## Installation

1. **Download Fabric Loader**: [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)
2. **Download Fabric API**: [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders)
3. **Download MineLights**: MineLights Release (TBD)
4. **Place the downloaded files** in your Minecraft `mods` folder.

## Usage

1. **Launch Minecraft** with the Fabric profile.
2. **Ensure third-party RGB integrations are enabled** in whichever software you use!
3. **Enjoy synchronized RGB lighting** while you play!

## Roadmap

- **Windows Dynamic Lighting**: Integration with Windows Dynamic Lighting is in development and will be available in future updates (hopefully this becomes the final standard someday ðŸ˜‚).
