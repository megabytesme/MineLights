MineLights is a Minecraft Fabric mod that brings RGB lighting integrations to Minecraft Java Edition (targeting latest, 1.21). Currently, it only supports Corsair iCue however due to the modular design, other RGB softwares could (and will) be easily added.

## Features

- **iCue Integration**: Sync your in-game events with your iCue-compatible RGB devices.
- **Biome-specific colours**: Each biome you traverse in-game will have its own specific colours!
- **Weather integration**: The weather in the current biome will show on your devices!
- **Block effects**: When standing in certain blocks (such as lava, fire and portals), effects will show on the keyboard!

## Supported RGB software
- **Corsair iCue** - full device support upto [iCue SDK 3.0.464](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk/releases/tag/v3.0.464).

## Installation

1. **Download Fabric Loader**: [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)
2. **Download Fabric API**: [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders)
3. **Download latest MineLights release**: [MineLights Releases](https://github.com/megabytesme/MineLights/releases)
4. **Extract and place the downloaded files** in your Minecraft `mods` folder.

## Usage

1. **Launch Minecraft** with the Fabric profile.
2. **If requested** allow "MineLights" and "Java" access to networks.
3. **Ensure third-party RGB integrations are enabled** in whichever software you use!
4. **Enjoy synchronized RGB lighting** while you play!

## Roadmap

- **Support Windows Dynamic Lighting**: Integration with Windows Dynamic Lighting is in development and will be available in future updates (hopefully this becomes the final standard someday ðŸ˜‚).
- **Update Corsair iCue SDK from V3 to V4**: Currently using [iCue SDK 3.0.464](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk/releases/tag/v3.0.464) (latest v3 release) since V4 is not as fully documented as I'd like it to be. Also, V3 supports everything currently.
