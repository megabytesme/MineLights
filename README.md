MineLights is a Minecraft Fabric mod that brings your world to life with dynamic RGB lighting effects for your peripherals. It targets the latest version of Minecraft (1.21+) and uses a modular design to support a wide range of hardware.

## Features

- **Extensive Multi-SDK Support**: Integrates with a wide array of RGB SDKs simultaneously, including OpenRGB, Corsair iCUE, Logitech G HUB, Razer Chroma, MSI Mystic Light, ASUS Aura, SteelSeries GameSense, and Wooting.
- **Dynamic Environmental Effects**: Your lighting changes in real-time based on your in-game surroundings.

- **Highly Configurable**: An in-game configuration screen (via Mod Menu) lets you enable/disable every feature, integration, and even individual devices.
